I will never forget that day, Oct 2nd 2013.

Many years later, I'll still remember the day vividly. Lovely weather, cute girl, crowded subway, night walk in Beijing Hutong.. all combined into a wonderful scenery. I'm pretty sure that what happened at that night gonna change my life track a little bit.

It's like one moment you feel like you're disgarded by the whole world, and the next moment the whole world is with you!

YES,love is so wonderful.^_^
